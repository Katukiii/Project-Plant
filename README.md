# üå± Smart Plant Watering System with ESP8266

This project is an automated plant watering system built using an ESP8266, a capacitive soil moisture sensor, a water pump, and a NeoPixel LED strip. It reads the soil moisture level and turns on a water pump if the soil is too dry, while also providing visual feedback using the LED strip.

## üß† Features

- Monitors real-time soil moisture with a capacitive sensor
- Activates a water pump when the soil is too dry
- Displays moisture status using a 6-LED NeoPixel strip
- Configurable moisture threshold and watering duration
- Low-power and Wi-Fi-ready for future expansion

## üíæ Arduino Libraries Required

Install the following via the Arduino Library Manager:

- [`NeoPixelBus`](https://github.com/Makuna/NeoPixelBus)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Wire everything according to the diagram above
2. Upload the Arduino sketch using the Arduino IDE
3. Adjust the soil moisture threshold and pump duration as needed
4. Power the system via USB or power bank

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

```cpp
const int MOISTURE_THRESHOLD = 600; // Adjust after testing
delay(5000);  // Watering duration in milliseconds (e.g. 5 seconds)
